# Stately

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Haegin/stately.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Haegin/stately)

A gem for managing state machines in Ruby that uses separate classes for states
and events, making it easier to manage complex state machines. If your needs
are simple you're probably better off with something like
[state_machine](https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stately'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stately

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
